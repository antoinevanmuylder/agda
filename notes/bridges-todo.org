* TODOS
** TODO go through CH paper and formalize their easy examples
** TODO bridge vars always lock annotated? /!\ see git issue #3
pre bridges must be lock annoted? eg bridge form, intro. In other words should
we use lPi' vs nPi' when writing types in internal syntax?
(tick x : Lk) -> A x  is 'the type of affine sections of A' (A must be affine in x as well??)

when typechecking application s r, a freshness constraint CheckLockedVars is generated.
** TODO must generate more freshness constraints
sometimes rules in CH ask for apartedness (freshness) but no check is performed here
I wonder if a PrimitiveImpl is really the place to have those freshness checks (except
right before a computation). I should have more constraints generated during typechecking instead?
r fresh for M means in particular that r not in fv M. since BI is registered a timeless
I should make sure that the freshness constraint wants no r in fvM.

Andrea: have (@tick r : BI) at the end
** TODO unsettled questions in code
marked by TODO-antva, or just comments in file Primitive/Bridges.hs
bunch of unsettled questions in code below.
** TODO handling of metas is probably unsound for now
** TODO if a freshness analysis fails, some error should be raised?
semi freshness when computing: see extent-beta/Gel-eta
freshness when typechecking: see TypeChecking/Rules/ pbly
** TODO what works for path var should work for bridge var
~grep -r "path" src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/* --exclude="*.txt*" --exclude="*.err*" --exclude="*.agda*"~
its reasonnable to think that path implementation should have bridge counterpart
*** cannot define bridges with left application. b : BridgeP x.A a0 a1,  b i = ...
forced to do b = lam i -> ... for some reason
see insertImplicitPatternsT, L92 uses piOrPath. it should be piOrPath or bridge :>
*** cannot refine C-c C-r and automatically intro bridge vars
** TODO should check the universe levels in the type of my primitives
Andrea: having A0 A1 R at same level is the way to go
** TODO there are TODO-antva's lying around
** TODO see github issues for more severe issues.
for instance: #2 is about lack of computation under lambdas for extent.
** TODO should write unit tests
** TODO CH does not say how cubical composition acts on bridge types?
not relevant
