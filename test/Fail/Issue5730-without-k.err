Issue5730-without-k.agda:13,1-4
Cannot generate inferred clause for seq. Case to handle:
  seq
    (ι _ _
       (Agda.Primitive.Cubical.primHComp {.Agda.Primitive.lzero}
          {.(_ _ ≡ _)}
          {φ = φ}
          u
          a))
    x
Cannot compose with type family: RecO (λ i → f (e i)) D (ι j).
